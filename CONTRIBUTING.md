Contributing
------------

Pull requests are gratefully welcomed. It would be appreciated if the following guidelines are followed:

* Make sure tests cover your change, preferrably with unit tests. There are quite a few slower tests that run the plugin 
against sample projects in the `test-projects` folder. You amend existing tests or add a new one if necessary.
* Follow semantic versioning and increment the minor or major version number in `pom.xml` and
`scaffolding.TestProject.PLUGIN_VERSION_FOR_TESTS`
* Update the the changelog: `src/site/markdown/changelog.md`
* Use [.editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/) to keep formatting consistent
